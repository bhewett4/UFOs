# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
The goal of this project was to build a webpage utilizing both HTML and JavaScript skills. We built out coding that would inport data, insert filters, and also load an image onto the page. We created five different filters that can be used to narrow down the data. We also have a display section for comments.

## Results
Below is a screenshot of the resulting webpage

The page is easy to read and the five filters that can be used to filter are
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

## Generating Results

As you enter your search critera and tab through the selections, it will filter down the different sightings as you get more specific. For example:
* Date: 1/10/2010
* City: Cary
* State: NC
* Country: US
* Shape: Changing

## Summary
At the end of this project, a webpage was successfully created that summarized UFO sightings and included a filter to narrow down the results. One specific drawback that I noticed to this webpage format is the lack of dropdowns. It will be difficult to filter results choosing a specific date, city, etc without knowing your options. Adding dropdowns would make this page much more user-friendly.<br />

To give this website more depth, I think we could add additional data points like how many sightings happened on the dates or different locations within the city in order to better triangulate a location. We could also add a comment box so people could provide additional information if they remember the specific UFO sighting. We know we aren't alone, let's continue to prove it to those who don't believe.
